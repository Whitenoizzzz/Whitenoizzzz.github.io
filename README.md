This is a simple Pomodoro Timer app that helps you stay productive and manage your tasks using the Pomodoro Technique.
I created this Pomodoro Timer app as a personal project to practice my web development skills and also because I'm a fan of the Pomodoro Technique. The technique has helped me improve my focus and productivity, and I wanted to create a simple tool that others can use to benefit from this technique as well.
